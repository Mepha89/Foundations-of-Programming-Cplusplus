In this assignment, you are to write a program in C++ that will simulate a tic-tac-toe game and will 
terminate in three cases:
1. The user enters a negative number
2. One of the players wins by having 3 consecutive squares, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally,
chosen with their letter (X or O)
3. All squares are selected and no player has 3 consecutive squares chosen with their letter.
Your program should repeatedly prompt the user for a square number with the following alternating 
prompts, starting with the first prompt and then using the second prompt, and then repeating the 
process again with the first prompt and then the second prompt :
Player X: which square number (1-9)?
or 
Player O: which square number (1-9)?
The user should input a number between 1 and 9.  If the square is invalid, i.e., not an integer between 1 
and 9 inclusive, then the program should output the following message on a separate line:
Invalid square selected, please try again.
If the square has already been selected in a previous input, then the program should output on a 
separate line:
Square already chosen, please try again.
This process should continue until 
(a) the board becomes full with no player satisfying the winning conditions, in which case the program 
should output
DRAW
on a separate line
(b) one player has selected 3 consecutive squares either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  In this 
case, the program should output
PLAYER X WINS!
or
PLAYER Y WINS!
depending on which of the two players had the three consecutively selected squares.
(c) the player enters a negative number, in which case the program should output the message
GAME ENDED BY USER!
before the program exits
