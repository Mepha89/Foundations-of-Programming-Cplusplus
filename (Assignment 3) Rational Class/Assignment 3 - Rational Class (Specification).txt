This assignment statement is taken directly from Problem 3.5 in the Exercise Book for the course (M. D. Adams, Exercises for Programming in C++ (Version 2021-04-01), University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada, Apr. 2021, xxii + 136 pages. ISBN 978-0-9879197-5-5 (ebook).)

Develop a class Rational that represents a rational number (i.e., a number of the form x/y where x and y
are integers and y 6= 0). The class should satisfy the following requirements:

i. A type member Integer should be provided that corresponds to the integer type used to represent the
numerator and denominator of the rational number.

ii. A constructor should be provided that takes two arguments corresponding to the numerator and de-
nominator values of the rational number, respectively. The first argument should default to zero. The
second argument should default to one.

iii. The class should provide move and copy constructors, move and copy assignment operators, and a
destructor.
iv. The addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators should be provided.

v. The +=, -=, *=, and /= operators should be provided.

vi. A member function toDouble should be provided that returns the best approximation of the rational
number as a double.

vii. A stream inserter should be provided to write a rational number to an output stream (std::ostream)
using a format like “-15/23”.

viii. All data members should be private.
